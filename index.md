# Welcome to miroLab

Multiplatform Interactive Robotics (miro) Lab focuses on developing sensing and actuating technologies and integrating them into interactive robots across various types and form factors, such as unmanned vehicles, biomedical wearables, and haptic interfaces. These platforms gather real-time data or provide cues to their environment, enabling precise control and coordination in dynamic tasks. The fusion of these technologies allows for enhanced human-robot interaction, where unmanned vehicles navigate safely and autonomously, biomedical wearables diagnose and monitor diseases, and haptic interfaces provide tactile feedback for immersive experiences.
